As the original developer for TridyDB, I would like to formally thank my thesis/project advisor:

* [**Dr. Youssif Al-Nashif**](https://github.com/ybalnashif)

For the help that I've received working this project, and just for the privilege to go in the direction that I did with it, considering that is not something I should take for granted. Thank you for keeping me on track; I know I often needed it.

<br>

I would also like to thank:

* **Dr. Susan LeFrancois**
* **Dr. Ashokkumar Patel**
* **Dr. Doga Demirel**

For their supporting roles in this project, and providing guidance that ultimately lead this to exist.

<br>

Finally, I want to thank the rest of the faculty at:

For sponsoring this project and leading me to where I am now. Without them, or those special few I mentioned above, I would never have made it to where I am now.
